                Developing a growth mindset has been a transformative journey that significantly impacted and aided me throughout my academic career. To change your mindset you must first change how you perceive struggle. By embracing challenges and difficulties you will force yourself to change how you think about hardships, building a tough and disciplined mentality along the way. For example, in my assignment for the "Working in the Computing Industry" module we were given multiple topics to choose from, that we would later write a 1,200 word report on. I had previous experience with all but one of the topics, some I'd even already wrote papers on in the past. <br><br>So naturally, because of this growth mindset I had been working on, I felt inclined to choose the one option I had no knowledge about. Whereas, a couple of years ago I would've chose the easiest option with no second thoughts.
                Since starting at the University of Brighton, I've learnt to view these challenges as opportunities for learning and opportunities to test myself. Instead of avoiding them and opting for the easier option, I now throw myself head first into the more difficult option, chasing the satisfaction of overcoming something that once seemed impossible. <br><br>Another valuable part of having a growth mindset is being able to seek, accept and learn from criticism. In my earlier days I'd often keep my work and achievements to myself 
                as hearing someone else opinions on what I was doing would completely discourage me from making an effort. Now, I am able to view constructive criticism as a valuable tool for improvement. Like when I received feedback on my learning journal for the "Computing Technologies" module, usually I'd not even seek criticism at all, but now I actively look for feedback on my work and use it as a blueprint for how I can improve. Even if the feedback is not what you were wanting to hear, or if you disagree with it entirely, it's important to think about what you can learn from it. It's never personal, but it is necessary in order to pin-point areas in which one could grow. The feedback I received on that assignment after seeking criticism at an early stage, helped me fix my errors early, which stops me from having to worry about them later on.

                <h2>Active Recall</h2>
                <p>Active Recall is a method of studying that reverses the typical studying format. Instead of trying to learn via putting information directly into the brain through reading or listening to lectures. The student can actively recall/retrieve information from the brain that they have recently learned, through processes such as answering past papers, or completing quizzes online to test themselves. </p>
                <div class="hiddencontent1">
                    <p>This process helps to solidify information learned, and allows students to remember this information easily and much more efficiently than if they were to just read the subject content over and over.</p>

                <h2>Pomodoro Technique</h2>
                <p>The Pomodoro Technique is a method of studying developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s, which helps students maximize learning efficiency, while minimizing distraction and burnout. The technique involves setting a timer for 25 minutes, and studying hard until the timer is up. The student can then allow themselves a 5 minute break, before setting another timer for 25 minutes and repeating the process again.</p>
                <div class="hiddencontent2">
                    <p>Upon completion of four cycles of the pomodoro technique, it is highly advised for the student to allow themselves a longer break. This longer break should be around 25-30 minutes, to allow for proper rest and rejuvenation.</p>

                <h2>Commenting Code</h2>
                <p>Commenting notes into code is an often highly overlooked technique for Computer Science students. By doing so, it forces students to articulate their understanding of the code they have written, therefore reinforcing their learning. A student in the early days of their academic career cannot expect to remember everything about their code by simply typing it out once and then moving on to something else.</p>
                <div class="hiddencontent3">
                    <p>Not only does commenting code help with the learning process, it is also a good practice for a student to take with them after their academic journey and into the workplace. Developers often work in large teams, so correctly commenting code will help others to understand and navigate the code you have written.</p>

                <h2>Leitner System</h2>
                <p>The Leitner System is a more efficient spin on the traditional 'flashcards' method of studying. A simple implementation of this system would involve having 3 boxes, all flashcards start in box 1. The student would go through the flash cards in box 1 and answer them accordingly. Any questions that were correctly answered would be placed into box 2, whereas any questions answered incorrectly remain in box 1. This process can be repeated (always starting with box 1) until all cards end up in box 3.</p>
                <div class="hiddencontent4">
                    <p>This system aims optimize the learning process by spacing out the review of information based on the student's proficiency with the content of each flashcard.</p>

                <h2>The Feynman Technique</h2>
                <p>The main concept of the Feynman Technique is that you should pick a concept or topic you want to learn. Then pretend as if you're teaching it to someone else, or a class of people. This forces you to put it into your own words, thereby solidifying the concept in your brain. It is considered good practice to identify gaps in your understanding as you go along "teaching". 
                <div class="hiddencontent5">
                    <p>Don't forget to go back and review what you have been covering also, consistency is key when it comes to knowledge retention.</p>
