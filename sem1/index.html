                    To create the 'Contact me' page of the website, we must first learn how to create forms using HTML. Without these forms 
                    the user would not be able to communicate with the website, it would be purely a one-way exchange. In this weeks lab excercise 
                    we will create forms using purely HTML and CSS, no JavaScript or anything else to handle interactions. <br><br>The forms will be 
                    non-functional and created purely as a proof of concept, ready for when we learn JavaScript in semester 2. After creating the basic 
                    form, with fields for a firstname and surname (both required fields), a website address and a message box, we started looking at 
                    other input types that are available for use in a form. After extensive research on the different types of input available to us, I decided to add a colour picker to my form. Along with this colour picker, I also added an option for users to upload files. Which is specified with the input type of 'file'. "The &lt;input type="file"&gt; defines a file-select field and a "Browse" button for file uploads." (w3schools, n.d)<br><br>
                    Before moving on to styling the form, we can make use of some features in HTML to ensure our form is completed correctly. For example, 
                    the user is now required to leave their name and email address if they wish to use the contact form. The email field of the form now also 
                    only accepts an input if the input contains an '@' symbol. The name and email fields now contain sample text, to give the user a better 
                    idea what information goes where at first glance. <br><br>Finally, the contact page was styled to match the rest of the website, so that the 
                    overarching theme stays consistent throughout.

                <p>
                    In week 8 we were introduced to the 'Flexbox' layout. After testing flexbox on a seperate site, I came to 
                    the conclusion that flexbox would be the better option for laying out my site compared to the grid we had 
                    implemented in the earlier weeks. This was largely due to how flexbox allowed me to create the site exactly 
                    how it was shown on the wireframes, whereas the grid layout took lots of extra CSS to get the desired look. 
                    <br><br>I created the new CSS for styling each box in the new layout and got to on transferring the old content into 
                    the new format. Alongside the flexbox layout, we also covered the multi-column layout, which was immediately 
                    cast aside due to not being able to provide the layout needed.<br><br> As I was moving the layout from grid over to flexbox, 
                    I had to make sure to add the media queries back so that the site stayed responsive. Anything below 600px and the site displays 
                    the layout intended for mobile use, between 600px and 800px the layout changes to the one meant for a tablet and finally, 
                    anything above 800px displays as the layout intended for computer use.<br><br>Finally, I decided to do some more work on the cards I created 
                    for the tutorial page last week. To achieve the effect you see on the cards, I started by adding a gradient and glow to the cards using 
                    pseudo-elements. The glow effect was created by simply blurring the cards, there is no "glow" property in vanilla CSS. Next we use the @property at-rule
                    to make the gradient rotate around the card. "The @property CSS at-rule is part of the CSS Houdini umbrella of APIs. It allows developers to explicitly define their CSS custom properties." (MDN Contributers, Jan 2024). 
                    In essence, this allows us to give the browser more information about how we want the animation to work. It is important to mention that this is still 
                    an experimental technology, although it is currently supported on Chrome, Safari and Edge - just not Firefox. <br><br>However, even if it wasn't supported on a user's browser, that's not 
                    an issue at all as the cards will still appear how they normally would, just without the animated rotation of the gradient. The only problem that arises from this is that the HTML and CSS validators don't really understand this experimental technology and will chuck out an error message saying that it isn't valid. When in reality, it is valid, it's just extremely new and therefore isn't fully supported yet.

                <p>
                    To start week 7, I created custom buttons using media queries and CSS properties to make the buttons
                    more interactive. When hovered over,
                    the buttons slide upwards and change colour, which gives a much more interactive feel. The user can
                    be sure that what they're hovering over is
                    actually a button which links to another page and not just a design on the website. With this, the
                    navigation bar was created, allowing for easy
                    access to the different pages of the site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Upon beginning the lab excersises, we were asked to add a banner to the page with a background
                    image. However, when adding a banner this way, when
                    the viewport is resized the image itself stays the same size and wouldn't produce the effect we were
                    looking for. Therefore, by changing the 'width' and
                    'max-width' CSS properties, we can make it so the banner resizes itself when the viewport size is
                    changed, thereby keeping it's intended look.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of labs and lectures, I started work on the tutorial page of the website. I started by creating 
                    a set of 5 cards, each with a different study skill on it. After this, I found a tutorial online which 
                    showed how to create a "read more" button using only HTML and CSS. I attempted to include this tutorial 
                    on the study skills page using the &lt;iframe&gt; tags. However, accross all browsers tested, I was presented 
                    with an error stating that "www.youtube.com is blocked". As a way around this, the video was instead added to the reading list. I was able to simulate a JavaScript 'click event' using HTML checkboxes, which 
                    when checked would expand the card to show the hidden info and hide itself when unchecked. This method is known among 
                    developers as the "Checkbox Hack". "This is a technique that allows you to control certain styles depending on whether checkboxes (or radio buttons) are checked or not." (G. Martsoukos, Nov 2022).
                    To finish off, I added content to the cards and created the necessary CSS selectors for styling and adding the 
                    final features to the tutorial page next week.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, I created a flexible video container to go on the tutorial page, which embeds the tutorial
                    video that I followed to created the 'read more' buttons
                    on the tutorial page. Using this method, when the size of the viewport is adjusted, the size and
                    aspect ratio of the embedded video will stay the same.

                <p>
                    In week 6, we started by sketching out wireframes to get a better sense of how we want the overall
                    site layout to look. We were
                    advised to create wireframes for different screen layout widths, so I created a seperate sketch for
                    a computer, tablet and phone layout.
                    These sketches are shown below:
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/wireframes.png" alt=" " class="wireframe">
                    <figcaption>The 3 wireframes detailing the site layout.<br>
                        <small>Screenshot &copy; UoB</small>
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    After a layout was decided on, a few tweaks were made to the HTML of site. A line of HTML was added
                    which forces mobile browsers to view the
                    page the same way that a desktop browser would. Before implementing the grid layout shown in the
                    wireframes, the stylesheet
                    must be reorganised to allow the responsive grid to work correctly. <br><br>Upon implementing the
                    grid, we followed the instructions shown to us
                    in the lab and then tweaked the settings to get our desired result. We used media queries to
                    determine at what point
                    should the grid change as the viewport is shrunk. When styling the layouts, we employed a "mobile
                    first" approach which meant mobile accessibility
                    and usability was the top priortity. "Media queries are a key part of responsive web design, as they
                    allow you to create different layouts
                    depending on the size of the viewport, but they can also be used to detect other things about the
                    environment your site is running on, for example
                    whether the user is using a touchscreen rather than a mouse." (MDN Contributers, Dec 2023)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, to finish this week, we went around and made some extras tweaks to the CSS to allow for a
                    more responsive site. For example, we made images
                    flexible so that the viewport can be resized without affecting the image, and hid some elements so
                    that they don't appear on smaller screens.

                <p>
                    The first task of week 5's lab session had us specify a font family with a fallback, incase a user's
                    computer
                    does not have one of the selected fonts installed. I decided to use <b>Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica,
                        sans-serif</b>
                    as my font selection. Tahoma is the font intended for the site, however if the user does not have it
                    installed,
                    Arial / Helvetica will be used instead. The site has been tested with these different fonts to make
                    sure usability
                    is still good if Tahoma is not present on the user's system.<br><br> Secondly, we were presented
                    with Google's online
                    font library, where fonts can be linked to the site files which removes the risk of the user not
                    having a font installed
                    on their device. Since, according to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), "The fonts
                    that are most safe to use are:
                </p>
                <ul class="fontlist">
                    <li>Arial / Helvetica</li>
                    <li>Times New Roman / Times</li>
                    <li>Courier New / Courier" (J. Morzinski, n.d.)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Due to this fact, I decided not to change my current font choices for one of Google's online fonts,
                    as the current font selection
                    fits the page and will be supported by pretty much all devices that would wish to access it.<br><br>
                    After tweaking the CSS of the fonts,
                    we started changing different properties in the CSS of the main body of the learning journal. This
                    involved fixing the margins of the
                    paragraphs so everything was aligned correctly, and using colours and borders to get a better
                    understanding of the site layout.<br><br> Finally,
                    to finish this weeks lab session, we learnt how to float an image and wrap text around it. This
                    technique was used on the image in week 2's post, which can be seen <a href=" #week2">here.</a>
                    As the viewport is shrunk and expanded, we can observe that when room is available beside the image,
                    the list will move from underneath and over to
                    the side of the image. Floating images like this allows for a more responsive webpage and stops
                    screen real estate from being wasted.

                <p>
                    Week 4 was our introduction to CSS, we started by copying a style sheet called 'normalize.css'. The
                    aim of this stylesheet is to help render all elements consistently and in line with modern
                    standards.
                    After this we copied a basic style sheet template which contained selectors for the elements of
                    index.html. We then used this template to style the body element by changing the font, the
                    background
                    colour of the page and the font size. <br><br>After this we began styling the other elements of
                    index.html,
                    such as; the table added in week 3, the <code>&lt;h&gt;</code> elements, the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>
                    elements, the <code>&lt;div id="wrapper"&gt;</code> element, the main menu and the
                    <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>
                    elements. Alongside this we also edited the pseudo-class selectors we were provided in
                    'stylesheet.css',
                    allowing for links to be styled in a way that potential users would be familiar with.
                    <br><br>In my free time for this week, I started working on buttons for the navigation bar of the website. I found out that by using the '::hover' 
                    selector and the 'transform' property, I can move the buttons along the Y axis when they're hovered over. This creates a sort of animated effect without the need 
                    for any JavaScript. <br><br>Finally, as
                    good
                    practice, we validated both our HTML and CSS with the corresponding tools provided by w3c.

                    In week 3, we had a more in-depth look into the various types of lists available to us in HTML. So
                    as well as ordered/unordered lists, we now have access to a different type of list called a
                    'description' list. Alongside the description list we also learned some more informatiton on nested
                    lists and how to format them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although it is relatively uncommon to come across a HTML table nowadays, we learned some table
                    markup for the sake of broadening our understanding of HTML in general. Not too long ago these
                    tables were still quite common, due to CSS support accross different browsers being sub-optimal.
                    However in the modern digital age accessibility is key, and if your website sells a product or
                    service, failing to make your website accessible can have some serious repurcussions. There are
                    multiple reasons as to why opting to use a HTML table for layout instead of the CSS layout
                    techniques:
                <blockquote><strong>
                        "Layout tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users: screen readers, used by
                        blind people, interpret the tags that exist in an HTML page and read out the contents to the
                        user"
                        (MDN Contributers, July 2023).
                    </strong></blockquote>
                <p>
                    Another reason is that table layouts require more complex markup
                    structures than its CSS counterparts, this can often lead to issues with writing, maintaining and
                    debugging the code.
                </p>

                    During the lab sessions in week 2, I started to add content to fill out the main body of the

                    <li>Linked multiple pages to external websites using an absolute link</li>
                    <li>Used different tags, including <code>h1</code> and <code>h2</code> tags</li>

                    <li>Added publication dates to all posts using the <code>time</code> tag</li>

                <p class="clear">
                    Everything detailed in the list above was completed during the lab of week 2. However, alongside this I did some of my 
                    own research concerning CSS. I had used HTML in the past, but never CSS. So I spent some of my free time this week watching online tutorials 
                    on CSS to prepare myself for the coming weeks.

                    To get started on making a basic HTML website, I first created a site folder. Stored inside of this
                    site folder are the files for the Learning Journal page, which was named "index.html". Shortly
                    after, I created a second and third page for the contact and tutorial pages, and linked them to the
                    learning journal to allow for quick and easy navigation of the website. Then I updated the copyright
                    details in the footer of the website to contain my name and a recent date. Finally, I validated the
                    HTML using the World Wide Web Consortium. This is important as it checks that your code is valid and
                    well formed.

                    In the first session we covered the outcomes of the course and where we aim to finish at by the end
                    of the year. I was introduced to the lecturers and contacted the Service Desk to get access to the
                    brighton domains website, which will allow me to build and host my website over the course of the
                    next few weeks.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To start things off, I decided to do some research into a possible roadmap for web developers to get a better understanding of what's to come. 
                    I found doing this rather beneficial, as it was able to prepare me for the topics of upcoming lectures and give me some insight into the industry itself. This material used is listed in the reading list.
